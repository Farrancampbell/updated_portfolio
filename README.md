# Updated Portfolio

I updated my portfolio, while working on our Trademark Project, I found a whole bunch of Third Party CDN's
we wanted to maintain a minimalistic feel on our project but from that point I worked to implement them into 
my personal portfolio.

The CSS was the most difficult part, but i am so happy with the result.
